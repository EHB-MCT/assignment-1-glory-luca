Event Planner / Task Manager

## Description
Our application is an event planner designed to provide a clear overview of activities and events across different dates. Users can easily modify event details, such as dates, names, descriptions, and more. As an event approaches, the app sends a pop-up notification with a brief summary of the event.

Additionally, users can choose to share their calendars publicly or keep them private. Public calendars can be viewed by others, while private ones remain hidden. The app also includes a social aspect, allowing users to add friends and receive notifications when a friend's event is coming up. Events can be shared between friends, and users can invite each other to common activities, with the recipient needing to accept the shared event for it to appear on their calendar.

**Note that this project is currently under construction and most features have not been implemented yet.**
